# Chapter 5 - INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING

## About This Chapter

This chapter summarizes three key concepts to be used in machine learning methods. Therefore, we will first start with random number generation as pseudo sensor data. This will help us while testing machine learning methods when there is no active sensor around. Then, we will consider feature extraction as a way of summarizing the acquired sensor data as the second concept. This will act as a bridge between Chapter 4 on data acquisition and following chapters. Then, we will evaluate sensor data normalization as the third concept. Finally, we will consider feature extraction from accelerometer data, audio signals, and digital images as end of chapter applications. These will show us how the topics considered in this chapter can be applied to real-life machine learning problems.
